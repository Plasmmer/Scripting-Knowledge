example bash:
/home/daniell/Desktop/online/install.sh is the most modern; should be followed
c2exports/scripts/status\ server/tt.sh: the first to have "if" in one line, together with /home/daniell/Desktop/online/online
/media/daniell/B/git/Floflis/shexec/shit: validates text characters; have the most detailed README.md in terms of install
Personal Issues/Issues Editor's /scripts/function_process_issues.sh is an example at looping into every line of output (while IFS="" read -r p || [ -n "$p" ])
Floflis Central's get-c2-proj-addons.sh is an example at reading only a specific line of output
-
example readme.md:
shexec and online
shexec and mlq now have the most complete README.md; flagships
No such file or directory. Installation has failed. (by-url installers aren't done)
